App to analyse training efforts, for personal use. Currently the app starts a local server which uses a local MongoDB database for storage. However, when deployed that will change and stuff will move around.

1. Build it: `npm run build`
2. Run MongoDB (separate shell: `mongod`)
3. Run it `npm start`
